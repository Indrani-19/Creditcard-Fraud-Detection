# Creditcard-Fraud-Detection
# Project Overview

Situation: Fraudulent transactions are a significant concern in the financial industry, leading to substantial losses for businesses and customers.

Task: Build a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm.
Action:
Preprocessed and analyzed an imbalanced dataset to handle missing values and normalize features.
Implemented the SVM algorithm to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.
Evaluated the model's performance using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.

Result: Developed an effective fraud detection system with high accuracy, helping to identify and mitigate fraudulent activities.
